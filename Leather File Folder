In a quiet corner of Old Willow Town, nestled between an antique bookstore and a sleepy coffee shop, sat a curious little shop called “Whispers & Ink.” Most people passed it without noticing. But those who stepped inside never forgot it.

One rainy Tuesday, a college student named Aanya wandered in, chasing shelter from the drizzle. The scent of aged parchment, wax, and something unexplainably magical hit her nose. The shopkeeper, an old woman with silver hair and glasses too large for her face, smiled without a word and handed Aanya a deep brown leather journal.

“No charge,” the woman whispered. “Just write your truth.”

Confused but intrigued, Aanya took the journal home. That night, she scribbled inside it:
“Wish I could just skip this final exam.”

The next morning, the campus power grid mysteriously failed, and all exams were postponed.
